# Redux-blog-app
This is a basic blog application built with React and Redux. It allows users to create posts, like posts, and view a list of all posts fetched from a backend using redux-toolkit and createAsyncThunk. This app demonstrates key concepts like asynchronous state management, state updates with Redux, and an interactive UI for managing blog posts.
